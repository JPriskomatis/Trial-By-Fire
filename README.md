This is my thesisproject for my Information Technology - Software Development Degree.
I created a 2d Action/Role-Playing game using Unity game engine and Ink! scripting language.
The goal of this project was to explore a dynamic dialogue system using branches based on the answers 
the player gave and on the effect their character had on the game world. Different paths should lead to 
different discussions, giving the player a feeling of freedom throughout the game.
